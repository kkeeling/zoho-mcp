## What is this?

This MCP server enables AI assistants to interact with your Zoho Books data through natural language. You can ask Claude to create invoices, track expenses, manage contacts, and more - all through simple conversation.

### Example Interactions

- "Create an invoice for Acme Corp for $5,000 for consulting services"
- "Show me all overdue invoices"
- "Record an expense of $150 for office supplies"
- "Email last month's statement to all customers with outstanding balances"

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Zoho Books account** with API access
- **Claude Desktop** (latest version)
- **Python 3.9+** or **Docker** (depending on installation method)

### Get Your Zoho API Credentials

1. Go to [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/)
2. Create a new client:
   - **IMPORTANT**: Choose "Server-based Applications" (required for OAuth refresh tokens)
   - Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:8099/callback`
   - Select required scopes: `ZohoBooks.fullaccess.all` (or specific scopes you need)
3. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Get your **Organization ID** from Zoho Books settings

**Note**: The MCP server handles OAuth token generation automatically - you don't need to manually generate refresh tokens.

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Using npx (Simplest - No Installation Required)

Configure Claude Desktop to use the server directly with npx:

**macOS/Linux:** Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows:** Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zoho-books": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["zoho-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ZOHO_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here",
        "ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token_here",
        "ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID": "your_organization_id_here",
        "ZOHO_REGION": "US"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! No need to install Python or download anything manually.

### Option 2: Using Docker (No Python Required)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zoho-books": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "ZOHO_CLIENT_ID",
        "-e", "ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "-e", "ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN",
        "-e", "ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID",
        "-e", "ZOHO_REGION",
        "ghcr.io/kkeeling/zoho-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ZOHO_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here",
        "ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token_here",
        "ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID": "your_organization_id_here",
        "ZOHO_REGION": "US"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Local Development Setup

If you want to modify the server or run it locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkeeling/zoho-mcp.git
cd zoho-mcp
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure Claude Desktop:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zoho-books": {
      "command": "/path/to/venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/zoho-mcp/server.py",
        "--stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ZOHO_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here",
        "ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token_here",
        "ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID": "your_organization_id_here",
        "ZOHO_REGION": "US"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### After Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Tools not showing in Claude Desktop"**
- Ensure the configuration file path is correct
- Check that Python path in config matches your installation
- Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes

**"Authentication failed"**
- Verify your Zoho API credentials are correct
- Check that your refresh token hasn't expired
- Ensure you're using the correct region setting

**"Module not found errors"**
- Make sure you've activated your virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- Check that the `cwd` in config points to the project root

## How It Works

When you use `npx zoho-mcp-server`, it:
1. Downloads the appropriate pre-built binary for your platform
2. Runs it with your provided credentials
3. No Python, no dependencies, no installation needed!

## Future Improvements

We're working on making this server even easier to use:

- **Dynamic Credentials**: Input credentials through Claude Desktop UI (no environment variables needed)
- **One-Click Install**: Desktop extension (.dxt) for automatic setup
- **Auto-updates**: Built-in update notifications and seamless upgrades
